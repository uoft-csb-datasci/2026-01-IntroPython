    "\n",
    "Introduction to Python is brought to you by the **Centre for the Analysis of Genome Evolution & Function (CAGEF)** bioinformatics training initiative. This course was developed based on feedback on the needs and interests of the Department of Cell & Systems Biology and the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of this course is a code-along style so it is 100% hands on! A few hours prior to each lecture, the materials will be avaialable for download at [QUERCUS](https://q.utoronto.ca/). The teaching materials will consist of a Jupyter Lab Notebook with concepts, comments, instructions, and blank spaces that you will fill out with Python code along with the instructor. Other teaching materials include a live version of the notebook, and datasets to import into Python - when required. This learning approach will allow you to spend the time coding and not taking notes! \n",

    "As we go along, there will be some in-class challenge questions for you to solve either individually or in cooperation with your peers. Post lecture assessments will also be available (see syllabus for grading scheme and percentages of the final mark) through [DataCamp](https://Datacamp.com) to help cement and/or extend what you learn each week.\n",

Because everyone gets stuck - a lot! Then you will learn how to get your data in and out of Python, how to tidy our data (data wrangling), subset and merge data. We'll take a break from data wrangling to spend our fourth lecture learning how to generate exploratory data plots. Then we'll slide into using the power of python and programming to use flow control before visiting text manipulation techniques in lectures 5 and 6. Data cleaning and string manipulation is really the battleground of coding - getting your data into the format where you can analyse it. Lastly, we will learn to write customized functions to help scale up your analyses. <br><br>\n",

    "2. **Code readability** - format and comment your code for yourself and others so that even those with minimal experience in R will be able to quickly grasp the overall steps in your code.\n",
    "3. **Code stability** - while the core Python code is relatively stable, behaviours of functions can still change with updates. There are well-developed packages we'll focus on for our analyses. Namely, we'll become more familiar with the `pandas` series of packages for working with tabular data. This resource is well-maintained by a large community of developers. While not always the \"fastest\" approach this additional layer can help ensure your code still runs (somewhat) smoothly later down the road."

    "As mentioned, Python is relatively simple to write, read, and therefore interpret, even by people that are not necessarily programming savvy; a contrasting difference with languages such as __C__ and __C++__, that are difficult to read and write. Simplicity and efficiency are at the core of Python’s popularity, as users tend to spend more time writing code than dealing with complex grammar, syntax, or debugging (troubleshooting) code. These same characteristics have made Python very popular among data scientists. Since October 2021, Python has topped the [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) (The Importance of Being Earnest) as most professionally used and taught language in the world!\n",

    "\n",
    "Python is a _high-level_, __object-oriented programming__ (OOP) language, meaning that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Many operations happen “behind scenes” without the necessity of explicit, low-level instructions given by the user. This gives you the flexibility to build programs rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Everything in Python is an object (numbers, letters, spreadsheet-looking objects, etc.), and objects occupy space in the computer’s memory; but users do not need to worry about allocating memory space for each object created because Python takes care of that in the background. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, functional programming languages such as Fortran and C require users to often write complicated, long, and detailed sets of instructions so the computer knows exactly what to do, making those languages hard to write, read, and debug. (By the way, Python is mostly written in C!)."

Your code runs and is executed, yes, but all those instructions that you wrote, if you want to save them, need to be manually _copied/pasted_ to a text processor such as Notepad, Vim, or Nano. This is a major drawback as we tend to reuse the code we write. Additionally, a key concept in science is reproducibility, and what better way to make your analyses reproducible than saving a detailed list of the commands that you used to generate those results? Do not worry, however, because there are workarounds to overcome this limitation of interactive prompts, without tedious and error-prone copy/paste methods.

    "## 1.6.0 Why would you want to use a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your needs, you may find yourself doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analysing data for your project using available packages\n",
    "- Re-analysing data for your project\n",
    "- Analysing multiple datasets for your project\n",
    "- Collaborating on data and analyses for your project\n",
    "- __Explaining__ your data and analyses to a supervisor or collaborator!\n",
    "    \n",
    "Jupyter allows you to alternate between \"markdown\" notes and \"code\" that can be run or re-run on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data run and it's results can be saved individually as a new notebook or as new cells to compare data and small changes to analyses!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6.1 What is markdown language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is a markup language that lets you write HTML and Java Script code in combination with other languages. This allows you to make html, pdf, and text documents that are combinations of text and code, enhancing reproducibility, a key aspect in scientific work. Having everything in a single place also boosts productivity during results interpretation - no need to go back and forth between tabs, pages, and documents. They can all be integrated in a single document, allowing for a more fluid narrative of the story that you are communicating to your audience (less distractions for you!). For example, the lines of code below and the text you are reading right now were created in Jupyter Lab's Markdown. (Do not worry about the Python code just yet. We will get there sooner than you think).\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, Jupyter also allows you to write in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/about/), a document preparation system to write mathematical notation. All it takes is to wrap LaTeX code between single dollar signs (\\\\$) for inline notation or two double dollar signs (\\\\$\\\\$), one at the beginning of the equation and one at the end. For example, the equation ***Yi = beta0 + beta1 xi + epsilon_i, i=1, ..., N*** can be transformed into LaTeX code by adding some characters: ***Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i, i=1, \\dots, N***. Now, if we use \\\\$\\\\$ before and after the LaTeX code, this is what we get: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i, i=1, \\dots,N \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "See? Just like that! \n",
    "\n",
    "We can make plots too:"

    "Packages are a way of structuring Python’s module namespace by using “dotted module names”. Packages exist to help organize modules and provide a naming hierarchy, which in turns keeps things organized in the same way that directories and subdirectories help you to organize files in your computer. The concept of libraries is what has made programming languages such as Python and R very popular, as any person can build packages and submit them for public use. This has allowed the participation of people from all disciplines in the development of packages relevant to their fields. \n",

    "In order to use packages, they need to be installed by the user, except for those packages that are installed by default (built-in) when Python is installed. To see a list of all packages already installed in your computer, run `!pydoc3 modules` in Jupyter or `pidoc3 modules` in a terminal."

      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    A procedural interface is provided by the companion pyplot module,\n",
      "    which may be imported directly, e.g.::\n",

      "        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",

      "    or using ipython::\n",

      "    For the most part, direct use of the explicit object-oriented library is\n",
      "    encouraged when programming; the implicit pyplot interface is primarily for\n",
      "    working interactively. The exceptions to this suggestion are the pyplot\n",
      "    functions `.pyplot.figure`, `.pyplot.subplot`, `.pyplot.subplots`, and\n",
      "    `.pyplot.savefig`, which can greatly simplify scripting.  See\n",
      "    :ref:`api_interfaces` for an explanation of the tradeoffs between the implicit\n",

    "\n",
    "The easiest and quickest ways of start getting help and debugging your code, is to simply copy/paste your error in search engines such as Google or DuckDuckGo. From those results, you can start narrowing down your search and even start using more specialized jargon that would give you more precise results. Below are some of the most common types of errors that you will encounter, along with recommendations to solve them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **File does not exist**: This error rises when your code is looking for a file in your current working directory but the file does not exist there. The ***os*** package is your friend to navigate the your computer's file system from within Python. Use ***os.getcwd()*** to check where you are working, type ***os.listdir()*** or the ***Files*** tab in the left pane to check that your file exists there, and ***os.chdir*** to change your directory if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Typos**: Python is case sensitive so always check that you've spelled everything right. Get used to use the _tab-autocompletion_ feature when possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open quotes, parentheses, brackets**: Jupyter highlights matching brackets, which helps to spot where parentheses or brackets are missing or not closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data type**: Use commands like ***type()*** to check what type of data you have.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unexpected answers**: To access the _help menu_, type ***help(module.function)***. Make sure packages/modules are imported before using the ***help()*** function. Alternatively, use a question mark (?) followed by the module/function: ***?module.function***\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function not found**: Make sure the package name is properly spelled, installed, AND imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cheatsheets**: Meet your new best friends: [Cheatsheets](https://www.pythonsheets.com/)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginners advice: At this level many people have had and solved your problem. Beginners get frustrated because they get stuck and take hours to solve a problem themselves. Go online and get help if books and ***help()*** did not help much.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Finding answers online_     \n",
    "\n",
    "- 99% of the time, someone has already asked your question     \n",
    "- Google, Stack overflow, the [Python.org](https://www.python.org/about/help/), SEQanswers, Quora, ResearchGate, RSeek, twitter, even reddit     \n",
    "- Including the program, version, error, package, module, and function helps, be specific. Sometimes is useful include your operating system and version (Windows 10, Ubuntu 18, Mac OS 10, etc.).       \n",

    "**Remember**: Everyone looks for help online **ALL THE TIME**. It is very common. Also, with programming there are multiple ways to come up with an answer, even different packages that let you do the same thing in different ways. You will work on refining these aspects of your code as you go along in this course and in your coding career.\n",

    "You may find that for some reason or another, you'd like to maintain a specific Python-environment (or other) to work in. Environments in Anaconda work like isolated sandbox versions of Anaconda ___within___ Anaconda. When you generate an environment for the first time, it will draw all of its packages and information from the base version of Anaconda - kind of like making a copy. You can also create these in the Anaconda prompt. You can even create ___new___ environments based on specific versions or installations of other programs. For instance, we could have tried to make an environment for a separate programming language, R version 4.0.3, with the command\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create -n my_R_env -c conda-forge/label/main r-base=4.0.3=hddad469_3`\n",
    "\n",
    "This would create a new environment with version __4.0.3__ of R but the __base__ version of Anaconda would retain version __3.6.1__ of R. A small but helpful detail if you are unsure about newer versions of packages that you'd like to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, you can update and install packages in new environments without affecting or altering your base environment! Again it's helpful if you're upgrading or installing new packages and programs. If you're not sure how it will affect what you already have in place, you can just install them straight into an environment. \n",

    "\n",
    "If you are inclined, the Anaconda Navigator can help you make a Python environment separate from the base, but you won't be able to perform the same fancy tricks as in the prompt, like installing new packages directly to a new environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ You should consider doing this only if you have a good reason to isolate what you're doing in Python from the Anaconda base packages. Perhaps you are installing a new or older version of the kernel to be compatible with a package you really want to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Anaconda navigator is a graphical interface that shows all fo your pre-installed packages and give you access to installing other common programs like RStudio (we'll get to that in a moment).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open up your Anaconda Navigator\n",
    "- Click on \"Environments\" in the left-hand pane.\n",
    "- Click on the \"Create\" icon at the bottom of the middle pane\n",
    "- You'll receive a dialog window for \"Create New Environment\". \n",
    "- Name your environment like __\"IntroPy\"__\n",
    "- Make sure the packages for __Python__ (ie 3.9) is checked off.\n",
    "- Click on the \"Create\" button and wait patiently for your environment to be created\n",
    "\n",
    "You will now have a Python environment where you can install specific packages that won't make their way into your Anaconda base.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- After the environment is made, you can left-click on the green triangle of R-4-0-3 (for example)\n",
    "- Choose \"Open with Jupyter Notebook\" from the dropdown menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will likely find a shortcut to this environment in your (Windows) menu under the Anaconda folder. It will look something like __Jupyter Notebook (IntroPy)__"
